# About BTCMobick (Mobick)

#### Mobicker 비트뭉/Bitmoong & Dominic (Mocean Trustech, Australia)

## 1.Bitcoin's Currency Phenomenon Reimagined by BTCMobick

The currency phenomenon emerges as individuals' beliefs in value converge, creating mutual relationships that gain objective value over time. In "Sapiens," Yuval Noah Harari highlights history's driving forces, where law, money, faith, and nation are examples of subjective interactions.

Since 2009, Bitcoin has epitomized this phenomenon. Bitcoin's currency journey involves: 1) Spreading via devotees' belief, and 2) Chance events like drug trades overcoming challenges of "value and diffusion." This establishes Bitcoin's currency status.
Author Oh Taemin designed the BTCMobick project to replicate Bitcoin's currency phenomenon. Actions like Satoshi Nakamoto not selling and shared beliefs enabled BTCMobick to overcome "value and diffusion" hurdles, successfully replicating currency phenomena.

Bitcoin, without a long history like gold and lacking a central authority's endorsement, became a global currency through trust. BTCMobick faithfully echoes this Bitcoin greatness.

## 2.Reviving Dormant Bitcoin Whales: BTCMobick's Early Impact

Bitcoin's emergence marked a historic event. Starting on January 3, 2009, individuals mined it driven by belief and curiosity.
Within four years, 10.5 million Bitcoins were mined, half of the capped 21 million supply. Around 5-6 million lay dormant. This constitutes over 25% of the total. The invariable 21 million cap sets Bitcoin apart.

Yet, uncertainty surrounds these dormant coins, impacting predictability. Market fluctuations follow their movement.
BTCMobick, launched on January 3, 2019, as a PoW coin, rewards holders. They have until January 3, 2029, to claim BTCMobick from dormant wallets, incentivizing awakening whales. BTCMobick's success depends on value, possibly revealing a million dormant coins, further enhancing predictability.

## 3.Exploring BTCMobick's Public Good Possessions

Since the hard fork, around 20 million BTCMobick coins have been issued by late July 2023. Of these, the Otae Bus Company holds 14 million coins, divided into 14 wallets with 100,000 coins each. The addresses of these 14 wallets are publicly accessible, allowing anyone to examine them. 
Despite owning 14 million coins, the transparency of wallet addresses places founder accountability at the forefront. If even one coin moves without community consensus, the BTCMobick project will end – a self-imposed restraint by the 
founder.

The 14 million coins will be shared between enterprises entering the BTCMobick network in the future and the Otae Bus Company. Further details on enterprise use of BTCMobick will be elaborated in next chapter. The BTCMobick retained by the Otae Bus Company will be employed to exhibit leadership within the BTCMobick ecosystem. For instance, it could be utilized to persuade miners during future hard forks or to maintain neutrality among various enterprises on the network.

## 4. 4.BTCMobick as a Multi-Purpose Blockchain Network for Corporate Applications

Satoshi Nakamoto's pioneering paper on a "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" proposed a solution for double-spending using P2P networks. Today's Bitcoin ecosystem has evolved through experimentation, embodying a spirit of continuous growth. Bitcoin's adaptable nature arises from its elegant simplicity, enabling resilience. In contrast, various altcoins highlight specific uses in whitepapers to attract investors. While this approach garners initial support, coins with preordained purposes face limitations.

BTCMobick acknowledges this dilemma post-hard fork. Instead of predetermining utility, it focuses on imparting value through careful distribution. With inherent worth, decentralization, and non-securities status, BTCMobick provides an optimal framework for enterprises, facilitating their adoption.
Considering individuals as society's foundation, the Bitcoin network reflects the most fundamental layer. BTCMobick extends this concept using Bitcoin's solidity and blockchain tech, forming a secure ground where enterprises can thrive within legal boundaries.

Enterprises intrigued by BTCMobick's network or seeking participation must commit to not selling BTCMobick. Even before gaining value, BTCMobick drew crowds in various distributions. 
This demonstrates that achieving business goals without selling BTCMobick is feasible. Upon agreement, Otae Bus Company shares a portion of their coins with enterprises. This allows enterprises to acquire valuable BTCMobick at no cost, fostering ecosystem growth without compromising user trust.

Furthermore, leveraging the transparent, neutral primary network engenders user trust. This interaction reinforces a robust network. 
BTCMobick's role as a universal enterprise network, offering versatility and value, solidifies through increased participation. 
While BTCMobick's specific uses aren't predefined, its value and decentralization support diverse enterprise applications. (Future mining will transition to public.)

## 5.Crafting Trustworthy Paper Wallets with BTCMobick

Before delving into the explanation, it's essential to grasp that exchanges, hardware wallets, software wallets, and paper wallets all demand trust in their respective components. BTCMobick was distributed exclusively through paper wallets during the project's progression. Why did BTCMobick opt for paper wallets?

5-1) Trustworthy Bitcoin Propagation via Paper Wallets: Paper wallets accelerate global Bitcoin propagation and bring us closer to the decentralized essence. When faced with physical Bitcoin transactions, mnemonic phrases aren't sufficient. Imagine trying to trade Bitcoin without recalling the mnemonic, like trying to transact using a locked treasure. If Bitcoin paper wallets were as common as banknotes, imagine the implications.

5-2) BTCMobick's Role in Paper Wallet Trust: As part of the BTCMobick ecosystem, BTCMobickus Corporation prepares to produce and sell paper wallets. By slightly embedding BTCMobick into paper wallets, the user can verify the authenticity of the wallet by performing a transaction using the secret key and confirming it with the address key. This simplifies Bitcoin transactions and storage for most individuals.

5-3) Lessons from Montville's Paper Wallets: Montville's distribution of 1000mo paper wallets was a noteworthy journey. This serves as a reminder that trust is crucial when dealing with exchanges and wallets.  The trustworthiness of print shops or hardware wallet manufacturers raises similar questions. Reflecting on these scenarios provides perspective.

5-4) Controlled Destruction and Trust: BTCMobick will be incinerated if no transactions are initiated by January 3, 2029. (Refer to section 2 for awakening dormant whales.) The primary reason is due to the risk of counterfeit wallets, leading to the decision to set a circulation deadline. 

5-5) Clarification: Andreas Antonopoulos' stance against paper wallets is well-known. He emphasizes the potential for security mishaps when individuals craft and use paper wallets. He recommends trustworthy hardware wallets instead. Is there a significant difference between relying on a trustworthy hardware wallet and trusting a reliable paper wallet?
